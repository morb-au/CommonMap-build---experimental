# This file sets the environment name for this CommonMap deployment.
# 
# It is mostly used as part of the domain name, e.g. role.$CM_ENV.commonmap.org
#
# Or you can use it to specify a subdomain in a software
#  development lifecycle, e.g.
#  role.$CM_ENV_SDLC.a-subdomain.commonmap.org
#
# We prefer you use a subdomain if you just want to work on
#  a particular aspect of the CommonMap API,
#  e.g. testing the import of a particular mapping agency.
